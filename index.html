            <p class="paragraph">I appreciate how hard it can be to make that brave first step towards healing, recovery and wellbeing. It can be challenging to be seen and to talk about painful or difficult experiences and feelings.  I offer calm, steady support and encourage the growth of self compassion and curiosity.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">With you in the driving seat, I’m your navigator, guiding a clear path through confusion and distress towards healing, growth and strength. All my therapeutic approaches are up-to-date, with evidence-based track records.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">I work flexibly and will try to fit in times that work for you.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">If you have any questions, please get in touch.</p>

            <p class="paragraph bolder">About Trauma, Attachment and Addiction</p>

            <p class="paragraph">From childhood and all the way through life, attachment and trauma difficulties can manifest in many ways, as people develop and unconsciously adapt their responses to what’s around them in order to survive as best they can.  These responses can include obsessive and compulsive behaviours, eating disorders, behavioural and substance addictions and destructive relationship patterns.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">All of these experiences can be bewildering and scary, meaning people often end up leading a life they wouldn’t choose, and which can include harmful and/or criminal behaviour.  So often, the individual has no explanation why they can’t stop or change thoughts, feelings and behaviours.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Some people are diagnosed with or have experiences which include symptoms of PTSD, Complex PTSD, personality and dissociative disorders.  I have in-depth training and experience of working with people across these difficulties, including those surviving organised abuse.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">There is a way through this, and recovery is possible. I’ve had the privilege of supporting many, many people to shift from a life of struggle and survival to higher levels of functioning and living.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph bolder">About me</p>

            <p class="paragraph">My training includes: an MSc in Counselling Psychology (2003), full certification in EMDR and Advanced EMDR for Dissociative Disorders (2005), Sensorimotor Psychotherapy for Trauma (2007), and Brainspotting (2016).  I draw from a broad range of evidenced-based approaches which have a good track record of efficacy.  I’m a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (Member 561136) to which I am professionally accountable and subscribe to their codes of ethics and conduct.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">I’ve worked in a wide range of settings, including work-place therapy support with central Government across Whitehall, addiction recovery and rehabilitation agencies and, since 2004, private practice.  I occasionally teach as a consultant on psychological trauma.  I work with great respect and honour for the 12 Step paths and work alongside an individual’s programme of recovery.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">I worked in a voluntary capacity as a Trustee, then Chair of NAPAC (the National Association for People Abused in Childhood) for seven years, giving clinical direction to the setting up and running of their support services.  I have run an on-line support forum for extreme abuse survivors since 2007.</p>

            <p class="paragraph light-color">I’m available in and around London, Essex, and Leicester areas - home visits are possible.
